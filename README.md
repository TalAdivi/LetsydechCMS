# LetsydechCMS

This is the content manager for [Letsydech website](https://github.com/TalAdivi/Letsydech).


The foundation requested a platform where they can manage their own content on the fly in an easy and intuitive way.

We used strapi as a base for our backend system to provide a nice clean UI with a complex plugin.

With the help of the platform we developed, "Letsydech" will have the tools and help to reach out to more women in need.
